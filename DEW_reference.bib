   abstract = {This is an analysis of the attempts to colonize at least 208 species of parasites and predators on about 75 species of pest insects in the field in Canada. There was colonization by about 10% of the species that were introduced in totals of under 5,000 individuals, 40% of those introduced in totals of between 5,000 and 31,200, and 78% of those introduced in totals of over 31,200. Indications exist that initial colonizations may be favoured by large releases and by selection of release sites that are semi-isolated and not ecologically complex but that colonizations are hindered when the target species differs taxonomically from the species from which introduced agents originated and when the release site lacks factors needed for introduced agents to survive or when it is subject to potentially-avoidable physical disruptions. There was no evidence that the probability of colonization was increased when the numbers of individuals released were increased by laboratory propagation. About 10% of the attempts were successful from the economic viewpoint. Successes may be overestimated if the influence of causes of coincidental, actual, or supposed changes in pest abundance are overlooked. Most of the successes were by two or more kinds of agents of which at least one attacked species additional to the target pests. Unplanned consequences of colonization have not been sufficiently harmful to warrant precautions to the extent advocated by Turnbull and Chant but are sufficiently potentially dangerous to warrant the restriction of all colonization attempts to biological control experts. It is concluded that most failures were caused by inadequate procedures, rather than by any weaknesses inherent in the method, that those inadequacies can be avoided in the future, and therefore that biological control of pest insects has much unrealized potential for use in Canada. © 1975, Entomological Society of Canada.

   abstract = {We present quantitative models that unify several adaptive hypotheses for the evolution of cooperative breeding in a single framework: the ecological constraints hypothesis, the life-history hypothesis and the benefits-of-philopatry hypothesis. Our goal is to explain interspecific variation in the occurrence of cooperative breeding in terms of interspecific variation in life-history traits and ecological conditions. We analyse two models, according to whether or not helpers can inherit their parents' territory. Major results are (i) territory inheritance always promotes cooperative breeding; (ii) if territories are not inherited, neither ecological constraints nor variation in life-history traits predict interspecific Variation in cooperative breeding; and (iii) if territories are inherited, the mechanism of density regulation is crucial in determining which factors promote cooperative breeding. If density dependence acts on the probability to obtain a free territory or on the survival of dispersers, variation in ecological constraints cannot explain variation in cooperative breeding. Lower adult mortality favours helping, not because it reduces the availability of free territories, but because it enhances the direct benefits of helpers. If density dependence acts on fecundity, lower probability of obtaining a free territory and lower survival of dispersers promote cooperative breeding. In this case, lower adult mortality works against the evolution of helping. We suggest that the difference between birds and social insects in the covariance between cooperative breeding and life-history traits is due to different mechanisms of density regulation that operate in these taxa, and we explain how natural selection on habitat choice might have caused these different mechanisms to operate.},

Species most severely impacted by Allee effects may be the very species for which these effects will be hardest to detect and overcome. This impedes effective conservation through a lack of evidence to drive management actions. We review the literature to identify (1) component Allee effects (components of fitness) which could lead to a demographic Allee effect (effect of all components on the population growth rate) in bird populations; and (2) traits that make species susceptible to component Allee effects. Concurrently, we assess the potential for undetected Allee effects to negatively influence the population growth rate of 14 critically endangered Australian bird species or subspecies. Whilst some (e.g. Helmeted Honeyeater) are unlikely to suffer from a demographic Allee effect, several (e.g. Great Knot, Orange-bellied Parrot) are susceptible to a number of component Allee effects and, hence, a demographic Allee effect. However, traits of the Regent Honeyeater suggests this species’ decline in particular is accelerated by an undetected demographic Allee effect. For this species and others, an inability to detect Allee effects need not preclude efforts to account for their potential presence through precautionary conservation management.},

   abstract = {Insights into animal behaviour play an increasingly central role in speciesfocused conservation practice. However, progress towards incorporating behaviour into regional or global conservation strategies has been more limited, not least because standardized datasets of behavioural traits are generally lacking at wider taxonomic or spatial scales. Here we make use of the recent expansion of global datasets for birds to assess the prospects for including behavioural traits in systematic conservation priority-setting and monitoring programmes. Using International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List classifications for more than 9500 bird species, we show that the incidence of threat can vary substantially across different behavioural categories, and that some types of behaviour-including particular foraging, mating and migration strategies-are significantly more threatened than others. The link between behavioural traits and extinction risk is partly driven by correlations with well-established geographical and ecological factors (e.g. range size, body mass, human population pressure), but our models also reveal that behaviour modifies the effect of these factors, helping to explain broad-scale patterns of extinction risk. Overall, these results suggest that a multi-species approach at the scale of communities, continents and ecosystems can be used to identify and monitor threatened behaviours, and to flag up cases of latent extinction risk, where threatened status may currently be underestimated. Our findings also highlight the importance of comprehensive standardized descriptive data for ecological and behavioural traits, and point the way towards deeper integration of behaviour into quantitative conservation assessments.

   abstract = {Birds have been comprehensively assessed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List more times than any other taxonomic group. However, to date, generation lengths have not been systematically estimated to scale population trends when undertaking assessments, as required by the criteria of the IUCN Red List. We compiled information from major databases of published life-history and trait data for all birds and imputed missing life-history data as a function of species traits with generalized linear mixed models. Generation lengths were derived for all species, based on our modeled values of age at first breeding, maximum longevity, and annual adult survival. The resulting generation lengths varied from 1.42 to 27.87 years (median 2.99). Most species (61%) had generation lengths '3.33 years, meaning that the period of 3 generations—over which population declines are assessed under criterion A—was '10 years, which is the value used for IUCN Red List assessments of species with short generation times. For these species, our trait-informed estimates of generation length suggested that 10 years is a robust precautionary value for threat assessment. In other cases, however, for whole families, genera, or individual species, generation length had a substantial impact on their estimated extinction risk, resulting in higher extinction risk in long-lived species than in short-lived species. Although our approach effectively addressed data gaps, generation lengths for some species may have been underestimated due to a paucity of life-history data. Overall, our results will strengthen future extinction-risk assessments and augment key databases of avian life-history and trait data.},

Some species bred each season, while others bred as infrequently as once in the eight seasons. Nesting occurred between the beginning of August and the end of January, different species showed markedly different starting and finishing times, and there were different temporal patterns of breeding within the breeding periods of the different species.The number of pairs that bred on the site varied each season, a pattern that we have previously shown to be related to the value of the Southern Oscillation Index before the start of the season. Nest success rates varied considerably between species, but the overall success rate on the site was approximately 50%.We estimate that the spotted gum forest habitat on the south-east coast of Australia (1200 km2) produces approximately 1.5 million fledglings each season.},

We then provide a framework for their use as proxies for more nuanced empirical data on species and ecosystems. Framework steps include (1) identifying information needs relative to conservation goals, (2) choosing relevant traits using theory and expanding via expert elicitation, and (3) defining and addressing the limits of trait information. Worked examples for contemporary plant and amphibian conservation show how traits should be selected and applied based on theory and/or evidence (rather than data availability or untested assumptions). Finally, we forecast the use of trait data in several conservation applications globally.},

   abstract = {Avian reproduction has four prime components: nesting, mating, hatching, and fledging. Predicting the probability of individual components helps in identifying the period of reproduction that would benefit from an increased conservation effort. Identification of biotic, abiotic, and sociological variables of the nesting sites is essential to calculate the component-wise success probabilities. There is no standard methodology to estimate these probability values separately. This study proposes a methodology to estimate the success probability of each component, identifies correlated environmental predictors, and provides a modelling framework to accurately predict the nesting success probabilities using Merops philippinus as a model species. Primary surveillance data and the proposed methodology indicate that the time window between the bird's nesting and mating is most vulnerable to environmental fluctuations. Both biotic and abiotic factors are crucial determinants of nesting success. Sociological factors also play a crucial role in determining the probabilities of these successes. Mating, hatching, and fledging success depend more on biotic factors than abiotic ones. Linear modelling frameworks are helpful in exploring which types of environments are better determinants of the success of a reproductive component. Artificial neural networks are useful in predicting mating, nesting, and overall reproductive success probabilities. Though the models in this study are developed using Merops philippinus data, the proposed methodology and modelling framework is also applicable for other bird species.},

In the north temperate zone, increased nest failure along edges of forest fragments is hypothesized to play a major role in the disappearance of bird species from disturbed landscapes. However, we lack comprehensive syntheses from tropical latitudes, where biodiversity is highest and increasingly threatened by habitat fragmentation and disturbance. We assembled data from five decades of field studies across the global tropics (1,112 populations of 661 species) and used phylogenetic models to evaluate proposed predictors of nest success. We found significant effects of several traits, including adult body mass and nest architecture. Contrary to results from many temperate locations, anthropogenic habitat disruption did not consistently reduce nest success; in fact, raw nest success rates were lower in large tracts of primary forest than in disturbed or fragmented landscapes. Follow-up analyses within species, using a subset of 76 species for which we had estimates of nest survival in habitats with different levels of disruption, confirmed that neither disturbance nor fragmentation significantly influenced nest success. These results suggest that nest predation alone cannot explain observed declines in avian biodiversity in tropical forest fragments, raising new questions about the demographic processes that drive extinction in the tropics.},

   abstract = {Over 750 native bird species reside in or regularly migrate to Australia, many of which have experienced rapid changes in habitat extent over the past two centuries. By 2020, eight taxa were considered Extinct and 10% threatened with extinction. Understanding the underlying extrinsic and intrinsic factors that increase extinction risk can allow prioritisation of conservation management and research. Here, we use state-of-the-art phylogenetic comparative models to reveal the most important biological traits that predispose Australian bird species to elevated extinction risk. We use an extensive database of their biological traits and relate these to each species’ national and global IUCN extinction risk status as assessed over the past three decades (in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020). We show that high evolutionary distinctiveness (uniqueness), island endemism, and an inability to take advantage of agricultural habitats were the most important traits explaining elevated extinction risk in species when phylogeny is controlled for, suggesting that extinction risk is disproportionately high in species with high evolutionary distinctiveness. Extinct taxa were characterised by large body mass and island endemism compared to taxa extant in 2020. Our study provides the largest and most up-to-date analysis of the intrinsic traits of Australian birds in relation to their extinction risk, and can be used as a baseline in future studies, for prioritisation of conservation actions, and for policy advice on a broad scale.},

   abstract = {Trait datasets are at the basis of a large share of ecology and evolutionary research, being used to infer ancestral morphologies, quantify species extinction risks, or evaluate the functional diversity of biological communities. These datasets, however, are often plagued by missing data, for instance, due to incomplete sampling, limited data and resource availability. Several imputation methods exist to predict missing values and recent studies have explored their performance for continuous traits in biological datasets. However, less is known about the accuracy of these methods for categorical traits. Here we explore the performance of different imputation methods on categorical biological traits combining phylogenetic comparative methods, machine learning and deep learning models. To this end, we develop an open-source R package, to impute trait data while integrating a simulation framework to evaluate their performance on synthetic datasets. We run a range of simulations under different missing rates, mechanisms, biases and evolutionary models. We propose an integration between phylogenetic comparative methods and machine learning imputation, and an ensemble approach, in which selected imputation methods are combined. Our simulations show that this approach provides the most robust and accurate predictions. We applied our imputation pipeline to an incomplete trait dataset of 1015 elasmobranch species (i.e. sharks, rays and skates) and found a high imputation accuracy of the predictions based on an expert-based assessment of the missing traits. Overall, our R package facilitates the comparison of multiple imputation methods and allows robust predictions of missing trait values. Our study highlights the benefits of coupling phylogenetic evolutionary models with machine learning inference to augment incomplete biological datasets.},

   abstract = {Nest predation rates critically influence avian biodiversity and evolution. In the north temperate zone, increased nest failure along edges of forest fragments is hypothesized to play a major role in the disappearance of bird species from disturbed landscapes. However, we lack comprehensive syntheses from tropical latitudes, where biodiversity is highest and increasingly threatened by habitat fragmentation and disturbance. We assembled data from five decades of field studies across the global tropics (1,112 populations of 661 species) and used phylogenetic models to evaluate proposed predictors of nest success. We found significant effects of several traits, including adult body mass and nest architecture.
